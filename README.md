# Why ?

Midterm project that made me learn about php and how it works.

# why bare php ?

I had no idea about laravel and such frameworks so i wrote everything from scratch.

That made me appreciate frameworks writers and importance of clean code.

###### I also had no idea how to write the word "components".

## set up
since it has no dependencies except mysql it should just work by enabling mysql plugin on php.ini and setting up sql db. After that change the credentials on config.php
